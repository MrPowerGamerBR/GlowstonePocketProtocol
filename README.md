# This is a Proof of Concept, currently obsolete!

This was going to be... well, what the name says, Glowstone with Pocket Protocol (MCPE, MCW10E) support, but, due to ProtocolSupportPE development, creating this project will be very redudant, since [ProtocolSupportPE](https://github.com/ProtocolSupport/ProtocolSupport/tree/mcpenew) also works in Glowstone (and in Spigot), so this project is now obsolete.

It may be continued if ProtocolSupportPE development is halted.

Now... let's talk about this PoC! It works! But, as the same says, it is a Proof of Concept, you can compile it, run the server, join the server using a MCPE client (port: 19132), walk around in the server, view other players, view entites, talk in the chat and view the world, that's it!
